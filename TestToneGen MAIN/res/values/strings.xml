    <string name="infoView1">\n•Hearing is the ability to perceive sounds. Sound occurs over a wide spectrum of frequencies.
								The human ear is sensitive to a frequency band within that spectrum expressed in decibels
								(dB).
								\n\n•Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called audio or sonic. The range is
								typically considered to be between 20 Hz and 20 ,000 Hz (Hertz).
								\n\n•Frequencies higher than
								audio are referred to as ultrasonic, while frequencies below audio are referred to as
								infrasonic. Loss of the ability to hear sound frequencies in the normal range of hearing is
								called hearing impairment.\n\n</string>
								
    <string name="infoView2">\nYou may have a hearing loss if:
        						\n\n•You hear people speaking but you have difficulty understanding what they are saying
								\n\n•You are frequently having to ask people to repeat what they have said
								\n\n•You feel left out of conversations
								\n\n•You complain that others are mumbling
								\n\n•You need to ask colleagues about the details of a meeting or presentation you attended
								\n\n•You miss jokes because you didn\'t hear all of what was said
								\n\n•Friends and family need you to turn the TV or radiodown
								\n\n•You do not hear the telephone and or doorbell
								\n\n•You have difficulty working out where sounds are coming from
								\n\n•You have a history of exposure to loud noise e.g. working in the construction industry
								\n\n•You understand more of what is being said if you are looking at the person speaking to you
								\n\n•Soft sounds seem to have disappeared altogether in speech</string>    
	
	
	
	<string name="infoView3">\n•Pure tone audiometry is the standard assesment of an individual\'s hearing.\n\n•The results of a pure tone audiometry test are recorded onto a chart called an audiogram.
	    					 \n\n•It is an easy method to obtain and provide information about an individuals hearing across a range of frequencies.
	    					 \n\n•A pure tone is a tone that has a single specific frequency.This tone is determined by the rate, or speed at which the sound waves vibrate.
	    					 \n\n•A 4000 Hz tone has a higher frequency than the 500 Hz tone.</string>
